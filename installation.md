# Installation

The `vpc` package is currently not on CRAN, although the aim is to release it there soon once all functionality is stable. To be able to install the `vpc` package directly from GitHub you will need to have the `devtools` package installed. On Window, you also need to `Rtools` installed.

    library("devtools")
    install_github("ronkeizer/vpc")
    library(vpc)
    ?vpc
