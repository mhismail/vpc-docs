# Customization

Below is a list of optional functionality available in the vpc package. Please see the *Customization* sections for more information.

- stratification (single & multiple)
- prediction-correction
- binning methods (K-means clustering, by time, by number of data points, by density, etc).
- automatated number of bins (using Sturges' rule) or manual input of number of bins
- plot without simulated data (`sim=NULL`), or without observed data(`obs=NULL`).
- general-purpose function (`sim_data`) to simulate data from a mixed-effects structural model, a fixed parameter vector and between-subject variability covariance matrix.
